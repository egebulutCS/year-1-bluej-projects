/**
 * The BeatBox is a class that can play rhythm tracks.
 * 
 * The tracks to play are defined by a sequence of calls to the beat box as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   newTrack  - start the definition of a new track.
 *   addBeat*  - add a beat to the track (call multiple times).
 *   endTrack  - end the definition of a track.
 *   
 *   start     - start playing the defined track.
 *   stop      - stop playing the currently palying track.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The beat box can also be used to do a single hit on an instrument by using
 * the 'beat(..)' method.
